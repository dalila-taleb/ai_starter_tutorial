# Welcome to ai starter

In this tutorial series, we will build a web application that uses OpenAI for text completion. The application will run in the browser and allow users to enter a prompt in a text field and receive a completion from OpenAI in a text area.

## What do we need to build this application ?
To build this application, you'll be using following technologies :

-   Python
-   Flask
-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript
-   OpenAI API

Throughout the tutorial series, we will start by setting up a virtual environment for the project and creating the basic structure of your web application. Then, we will create the front-end of our application using HTML, CSS. After that, you'll integrate the OpenAI API into your application to generate text completions, and then call it from our frontend using some javascript.

**Here's an overview of the different parts of your tutorial series:**

1.  Setting Up Your Environment: In this part, you'll create a virtual environment for your project and set up Flask.
    
2.  Building the Front-End: In this part, you'll create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the front-end of your application, including the user input form.
    
3.  Integrating the OpenAI API: In this part, you'll integrate the OpenAI API into your application and use it to generate text completions based on user input.
    
4.  Deploying Your Application: In this part, you'll deploy your web application to a hosting platform so that it can be accessed by others.
    
## Goal
By the end of this tutorial series, you'll have a fully functional web application that can generate natural language text completions using OpenAI. So let's start, and have fun building!
